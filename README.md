# EDA on Freelancer & Shopping Datasets

## Overview
This repository contains two Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects:  
1. **Global Freelancers Dataset** – Analysis of freelance professionals’ demographics, skills, and hourly rates.  
2. **Customer Shopping Trends Dataset** – Analysis of customer shopping behavior and purchasing preferences.  

The goal of this project is to **explore, clean, and visualize data** to identify meaningful patterns and insights.

## Datasets
- [Global Freelancers Raw Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/urvishahir/global-freelancers-raw-dataset)
- `shopping_trends_updated.csv` (customer shopping behavior dataset)

---

## Tech Stack & Libraries
- **Python** for data analysis  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  
- **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib** for data visualization  
- **Missingno** for missing value analysis

## Key Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Removing duplicates  
   - Standardizing column names  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Summary statistics  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Visualizing distributions and relationships between variables  

3. **Insights:**  
   - Trends in freelance hourly rates based on skills and location  
   - Patterns in customer shopping preferences and demographics

## Sample Visualizations
- Distribution plots for hourly rates and customer spending  
- Heatmaps showing correlations  
- Missing value matrix visualizations

## Future Work
- Apply machine learning models for prediction (e.g., customer segmentation, rate forecasting).  
- Automate reporting and dashboards.
